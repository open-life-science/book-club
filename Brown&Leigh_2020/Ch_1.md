# The significance of crashing past gatekeepers of knowledge: Towards full participation of disabled scholars in ableist academic structures
_by Claudia Gillberg_

**Q1:** Gillberg speaks of "personal and political decisions in a highly political context" and "unremunerated additional labour" (page 13) when discussing the work of disabled scholars. Are these experiences unique to disabled people? What might make "disability" a unique characteristic vis-à-vis other "protected characteristics" (such as race, gender identity, and age)?

**Q2:** How does Gillberg conceive of "participation"? (see pages 15 and 16.) How does this conception compare to yours?

**Q3:** In §Activism and Reciprocal Learning, Gillberg introduces more ideas of Addams' and asks whether dialogue between activists and academics is even possible these days. What do you think? How can such exchanges help?

**Q4:** "Whatever emanates from a disabled body must therefore comprise at best fringe or 'special' knowledge, an addition or footnote" (page 20). Here, Gillberg goes on to say how discussions about disability are often seen as a separate topic. What area do you work in and how can disability studies inform what you do?

**Q5:** What do you think about Gillberg's "validity criteria"? (Pages 22 and 23.)
