# Internalised ableism: Of the political and the personal
by Jennifer Leigh & Nicole Brown

**The authors insist on the value of rigorous autoethnographies to understand cultures. This is not the first time we encounter this in the book. Are there other fields where you have encountered autoethnography as a common method of study? Why do you think so many of the chapters rely on this method?**

**In _§Neoliberal Academia as a Workplace_, Leigh and Brown suggest definitions of perfectionism and its impact on the wellbeing of academics. Do you see yourself being a perfectionist in academia? If yes, what would happen if you weren’t a perfectionist?**
