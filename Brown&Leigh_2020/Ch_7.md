# 'But you don'y look disabled': Non-visible disabilities, disclosure and being an 'insider' in disability research and 'other' in the disability movement and academia
by Elisabeth Griffiths

**Griffiths explains disability is clearly identified in the Equality Act, there are measures she knows help in the workplace (“special” keyboard and mouse), and these measures can be implemented by employers, particularly thanks to the duty of providing reasonable adjustments captured in the law. My (very) provocative question is: Is it fair to say that Griffiths’ experience of disability is (somewhat) privileged? Might this partly explain why she claims to “comfortable [in] being acknowledged as having a disability within the eyes of the law” (128)?**

**In _§My ‘coming out’_, Griffiths explains she and a colleague had been described as “brave and courageous” for doing so. However, as she then explains, “bravery and courage, words synonymous with endurance and battle, suggest that [she has] a choice in accepting this sometimes daily encounter with pain and discomfort, that [she has] willingly entered the fray to tussle with the physical embodiment of my illness” (131). The linguistic note is important. Consider, anecdotally, Genomics England’s criticism of “suggesting they’re a ‘superhero’ or ‘brave’ or ‘inspirational’ for living with these conditions” (2022: 7). However, is there something to identifying “coming out” as courageous?**

**Griffiths identifies fluctuation as a defining experience of “the chronically ill, who ‘weave in and out of disability’ (Pinder, 1996: 153)” (136). Returning to the legal discussion, can you think of how any of the other protected characteristics identified in the Equality Act also “fluctuate”?**
