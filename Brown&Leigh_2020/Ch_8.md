# Invisible disability, unacknowledged diversity
by Carla Finesilver, Jennifer Leigh and Nicole Brown

**Finesilver et al. point to the discrepancy between how universities treat their staff and students in what regards disability. Whilst there may be “disability support services for students that provide advice and equipment, [there is] little similar provision available to staff” (149). Is this true of the institution where you work? How might greater support for disabled academics affect the diversity of the academic workforce?**
