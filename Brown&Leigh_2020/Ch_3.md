# Disclosure in academia: A sensitive issue

by Nicole Brown

**Brown, the author of this chapter, has fibromyalgia. She presents research she did with fibromyalgia patients. Brown mentions "she felt drawn into the patients' world in a way [she] feared would disrupt [her] analysis and understanding of what was happening" (57). Brown admits this closeness did help her coordinate with the research participants in a way that ensured their wellbeing throughout the project. In what other senses might sharing the experiences of one's research participants improve such a project's methods and findings?**

**What do you think about the three conditions Brown lists to enable disclosure in _ยง'Disclosure distances' in academia_? And how about the distinction between disclosure as both a private and a public matter? Is the end game to make otherwise hidden disabilities known?**
