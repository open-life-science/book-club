This repo contains discussion prompts for OLS #book-club meetings. The above folders list books as we read them. Each folder contains questions relevant to the sections read before each discussion. 

If you are in OLSâ€™ Slack workspace, you are very welcome to join the #book-club channel! If you are already a member, please feel free to create a pull request suggesting further prompts for book sections. You may also raise an issue to discuss:
* How this repo can best be utilised, or
* What book to read next!
