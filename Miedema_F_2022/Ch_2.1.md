# Part 1. Images of Science, a Reality Check
**In the Introduction, Miedema speaks of the "frontstage-backstage paradox." What do you think about this paradox? Is it unique to science? Is it relevant to science as a whole or only certain practices within science?**

**What do you think about the hard-soft sciences distinction? Does it serve a purpose when thinking about research?**

**When discussing §The Mertonian Social Order, Miedema mentions intellectual heavy-weights such as Merton, Latour and Hacking, but also notes that these authors are not usually read during the career of a scientist. How might reading on the history, philosophy and sociology of science help scientists in their work?**

**Miedema argues that the sociological image of science is one of "vocational altruistic investigators" (p. 22). Have you ever considered science in this way?**

**We are introduced in §Possessed by the Normative, Demanding the Descriptive to Kuhn's "paradigm shifts," which provoked a paradigm shift in the study of science. By Miedema's account, the key change Kuhn inspired was his emphasis on the history of science. No question here, just a cheeky mention of [*An Incomplete History of Research Ethics*](https://www.tiki-toki.com/timeline/entry/1753034/A-History-of-Research-Ethics/), which I will be developing during my time as project lead in the OLS-5 cohort! :tada:**

**In §The Empirical Turn in the Sociology of Science, we learn of the improvement in the field brought about by sociology of scientific knowledge (SSK) in the 1960s and 1970s. Miedema sees Shapin's embrace of "non-cognitive factors" as an influence on science as an important aspect of the new SSK. What "non-cognitive factors" have you encountered in research and research practices?**

**Miedema begins §The Myths of Science: Frontstage and Backstage by claiming that being "honest" and "frank" (p. 33) about the limits of science is positive. This is despite the detriment to the "Legend" of science. What do you think? Can the credibility of science withstand scientific "honesty"?**
