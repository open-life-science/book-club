# Transition to Open Science

**Miedema introduces the term “responsible research and innovation” in §7.1., pointing to papers that trace its history. Notably, the term gained traction at the start of the 2010’s with EU’s _Horizon 2020_ strategy (Owen et al., [2012](https://doi.org/10.1093/scipol/scs093)). How do you generally conceive of the term?**

**arXiv, PLOS and the Budapest Open Access Initiative are mentioned as some of the earliest instigators of the Open Science movement. Are you aware of any earlier such initiatives?**

**In §7.7., Miedema references some concerns about the open science movement, including that it is "naive or the next neoliberal trick" (202). Miedema does not present the concerns very convincingly, nor does he respond to them adequately. Do you have a more convincing notion of the concerns? Are there any responses you would like to give to the concerns raised? In particular, are there any open access models that you find do not disadvantage scholars in the global south?**

**In §7.8., Professor Mamokgethi Phakeng asks three questions worth discussing:**

* **What are the shared values between research and sound democracy?**
* **Should all of our research be for the public good?**
* **How does the way we measure impact shape our research?**
