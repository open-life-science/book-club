# *Open Science: the very idea* (Miedema, [2022](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-94-024-2115-6)) is the first book the OLS Book Club is reading! :tada:

The book is open access and can be read online for free directly from the [publisher](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-94-024-2115-6).

The plan is to read a section each week to discuss over Slack between Wednesday and Sunday (so there is flexibility around as many schedules as possible!). The files above contain the questions or reflection prompts for each section (as we reach them). This is to ensure the facilitator of the discussion has thoughts to fall back on!  All readers are welcome to draw on them to think further about the book.

# Reading Plan
The schedule for discussing the book is as follows:
| Week number | Discussion dates | Section/chapter |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 26-30 Jan | Chapter 1 |
| 2 | 02-06 Feb | Chapter 2, §2.1. |
| 3 | 09-13 Feb | Chapter 2, §2.2-2.3 |
| 4 | 16-20 Feb | Chapter 3, §3.1-3.9 |
| 5 | 23-27 Feb | Chapter 3, §3.10-3.15 |

| 7 | 09-13 Mar | Chapter 5 |
| 8 | 16-20 Mar | Chapter 6 |
| 9 | 23-27 Mar | Chapter 7 |

# Some Generic Questions
Three generic questions are that book club meetings can turn to are:
* What's the author trying to say? (What's the thesis?)
* Is the author's argumentation sound?
* What did you learn from the chapter or section?
