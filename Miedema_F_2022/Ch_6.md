# Science in Transition Reduced to Practice

**Miedema shifts gear for this chapter and begins by discussing the “managerial challenges” (163) involved in aligning multidisciplinary research projects with broader organisational objectives whilst breaking down silos within matrix organisations. He identifies external networking as key to the success of such initiatives, but also the role of expertise in governance. How do you engage with your institution’s governance structures?
