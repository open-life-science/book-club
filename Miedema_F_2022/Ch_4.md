# Science for, in and with Society: Pragmatism by Default
**To supplement the opening section's description of the relationship between pragmatism and analytic philosophy, consider Misak & Talisse ([2019]()).**

**ยง4.2. points to what seems to be Miedema's thesis: that today's researchers should learn from pragmatism. He then provides a version of the history of pragmatism. Are there any papers or books that you have found helpfully welcome non-philosophy researchers to the study of philosophy (not necessarily in the pragmatist tradition)?**
