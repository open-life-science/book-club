# Science in Social Contexts

**Drawing a link between the Frankfurt School and pragmatism, Miedema reads Habermas (in Technology and Science as Ideology) as worrying that military and commercial motives drive scientific research programmes. Miedema cites Habermas arguing for “the strict separation between the function of the expert and the politician [being] replaced by a critical interaction” (134). What role do you see for the “politician” or the wider public in setting the agenda for scientific research? Where does this leave the idea of “expertise”? (For a more nuanced analysis between the Frankfurt School and American pragmatism, consider reading Tong ([2006](https://www.jstor.org/stable/30209971)).)**

**Miedema introduces two perspectives on power. On the one hand, Habermas is seen as arguing that institutions must engage with the public to better distribute power. Conversely, Foucault is interpreted as arguing that the institutions are the problem — that they must be significantly reformed. How do you see this issue at play in your academic work? Do you see increased need to work with the public? Do institutional mechanisms allow for this? If not, how should they be improved?**

**In §5.3., we learn of Kitcher’s Well-Ordered Science, his concepts of “significant knowledge” and “enlightened democracy”. The former points to the aim of science: to produce knowledge for humankind to better navigate society and the world. The latter hints at the risk of a democratic approach to science that detracts from the alleged importance of intellectual elites. In your own words, how would you define the ideal type of knowledge that results from scientific inquiry? What challenges might you face if you had to campaign for your definition of “significant science“ before a democratic forum?**

**In what instances have you seen science adequately be transparent about its structures before the public? What concerns do you foresee in greater public scrutiny?**

**Section §5.6. mentions some “fluctuations” in funders’ interests in the 70s and 80s. Which fields do you see drawing more attention from funders in recent times?**
